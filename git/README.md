# 📘 Git CLI Experiments & Utilities

This repository is a collection of practical Git command-line experiments, scripts, and usage patterns.

The goal is to explore and document real-world usage of Git from the terminal — beyond just basic version control — including:

* 🔍 Inspecting and analyzing repositories
* 🧪 Testing edge-case behaviors
* 🛠️ Custom CLI wrappers for advanced workflows

---

## 📂 Structure

Each experiment lives in its own folder, with a `README.md` describing the use case and examples.

Example folders might include:

* `commit-signing/`
* `interactive-add/`
* `clean-filtered-files/`
* ... and more

> This is an evolving repo — built to make Git a little less mysterious and a lot more powerful.
