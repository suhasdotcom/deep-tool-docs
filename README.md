# 🧠 deep-tool-docs

A hands-on, community-driven collection of **real-world experiments**, **deep dives**, and **hard-earned insights** into developer tools like `git`, `gpg`, `pytest`, `python`, and more.

Think of this as your go-to lab notebook — documenting strange behaviors, quirky flags, corner cases, and handy workflows that aren’t always in the official docs.
